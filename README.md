PID-DEMO-BOARD
==============

A PID demonstration board designed to show the effects of the various feedback terms in a real system. A Lego motor is used for mechanical simplicity as mounting is much easier.

An ATMEGA48 is used as the embedded chip to control the PID system. The Lego motor is controlled using PWM signals generated by the ATMEGA48 and feedback from the motor shaft is read from a potentiometer using the built-in ADC. The three feedback terms (i.e. proportional, integral, and derivative) as well as the desired input position are also controlled with potentiometers.
